  <Notify12Final_Label>Dragon's Descent 1.2 (Worship)-Final</Notify12Final_Label>
  <Notify12Final_Message>Dragon's Descent Version 1.2 (Worship) was loaded instead of 1.3 (Mind, X, and X).\n\nThis has happened due loading Rimworld on version 1.1. The newer features/updates rely on the latest 1.2 stable version of Rimworld to function properly.\nThis version of Dragon's Descent will no longer be receiving any more updates/support but will still function with 1.1, your saves will continue being safe to use.\n\nUpdating to Rimworld 1.2 is highly recommended if you want to continue recieving new features and fixes, especially regarding AI and abilities.</Notify12Final_Message>
